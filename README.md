## 🧠 Project Overview

As part of my personal finance initiative, I developed a full financial model by consolidating historical balance sheet, revenue, COGS, and expense data from the past three years (2021–2023). The model emphasizes:

- 📌 Data structuring and cleaning
- 📌 Dynamic financial forecasting
- 📌 Scenario analysis (Best, Base, Worst)
- 📌 KPI evaluation
- 📌 Five-year financial projections
